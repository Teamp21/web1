    <p>Step 1. Cut the pork loins crosswise by laying them on a cutting board, holding the knife parallel to the board. Place the non-dominant hand on top of the pork, while carefully slice the pork in half along its length by cutting between your hand and the cutting board. Stop when it's almost to the other edge.</p>
    <p>Step 2. Open the cut meat and lay flat, place a piece of plastic wrap on top and pound the meat with a mallet.</p>
    <p>Step 3. Season the unfold-side with salt, black pepper and cooking wine for 15 minutes and place half slice of American slice on each side.</p>
